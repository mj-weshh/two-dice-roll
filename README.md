# Dice Roll Script

This Python script simulates the rolling of a pair of dice. It generates two random numbers between 1 and 6, representing the result of rolling two dice.

## How It Works

The script defines a `Dice` class with a method `roll()`, which simulates the rolling of two dice. Here's how it works:

1. **Initialization**: The script imports the `random` module, which is used to generate random numbers.

2. **Dice Class**: The `Dice` class contains a method named `roll()`. When this method is called, it generates two random numbers between 1 and 6 using the `random.randint()` function.

3. **Rolling Dice**: When you create an instance of the `Dice` class and call the `roll()` method on it, it returns a tuple containing the results of rolling two dice.

## Usage

1. Ensure that you have Python installed on your system.
2. Download the `dice_roll.py` script to your computer.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the script is located.
4. Run the script using the command `python dice_roll.py`.
5. The script will output the result of rolling two dice, which will be two random numbers between 1 and 6.
